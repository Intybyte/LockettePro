# LockettePro
### LockettePro - 1.20.4

This fork is yet another continuation of LockettePro, this fork started at https://github.com/brunyman/LockettePro.

LockettePro is a block-protection plugin based on Lockette (https://github.com/Acru/Lockette).

The plugin behaveso 100% same as https://github.com/brunyman/LockettePro. I only made some refactors and applied some common sense to make it easier to edit and understand in case there are bugs (I wish not).

This fork was made for the server Winterfell as the old fork didn't support 1.20.4.
